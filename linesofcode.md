# writing our first lines of code and installing packages
i supose that you have done every step in [getting-started](getting-started.md)<br>
so now we will use visual studio code(not visual studio 2019)<br>

NOTE: if you dont have visual studio go to [https://rdir.net/visual-studio-download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

so now type `code .` in your command prompt as you can see visual studio will pop open<br>
now click `CTRL`+`N` and then clcik `CTRL`+`S` now rename it to index.js now click `Save`<br>
isnt this cool we got our OWN .js file! i know it must be exciting!<br>
so now go to `Terminal` in up right in visual studio click it now choose `New Terminal`<br>
now type `npm init` fill in your info<br>
and when your done type `npm install discord.js` wait for few seconds<br>
now goto your index.js and type the following<br>
```
// import lib
const Discord = require('discord.js')
```

sorry to say but i wont be adding any thing more untill feb 1 2021 you could check the [offical guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) and contuine from there :(
